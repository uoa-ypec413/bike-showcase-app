## Bike Showcase App

We have developed an Android application using Android Studio, to showcase bikes.

Our bikes fall under 4 categories: Road, Mountain, Adventure, and Kids.

From the main screen users can select a category to view a list of bikes in that category, and sort these by alphabetical order or price.
They can click on a bike in the list to view it's details and navigate through images of the bike.

Users can also view "Top Picks" from the main screen, which is a selection of the most viewed bikes. From here, they can also view a particular
item's details.

Users can search for a bike using the search bar in the main screen. This will provide them with a list of bikes that match the search query, from which they can
select a bike to view it's details.
